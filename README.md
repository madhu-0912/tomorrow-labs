# Tomorrow Labs

Tomorrow Labs is my personal innovation workspace where I design, build, and experiment with ideas across:

- Software Engineering
- Machine Learning
- Artificial Intelligence
- Data Systems & Automation
- Applied Research & Prototyping

This repository follows a structured monorepo approach where multiple independent projects live together, enabling reusable components, shared utilities, and consistent engineering practices.

## Purpose
To continuously learn, build, and innovate — turning ideas into real, working systems.

## Areas of Exploration
- AI & LLM Systems
- Machine Learning Pipelines
- Intelligent Automation
- Data Engineering
- Experimental Prototypes
- Scalable Software Systems

> Building today. Engineering tomorrow.
